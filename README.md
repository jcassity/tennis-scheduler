Base template for mern stack from this tutorial: 
https://github.com/SinghDigamber/react-axios-tutorial

A simple tennis match scheduling app.
The purpose of this app is to allow captains of local tennis leagues have a visual aid for creating match lineups.

The Project is made on a mern stack and is our first project using React and Node, so there will likely be some mistakes throughout the code.

Instructions for running:
1) clone repo
2) install node and mongodb if not already installed
3) cd into directory
4) run the command "npm install"
5) run the command "npm run dev"
6) The React front-end runs on localhost:3000 and the Node.js back-end runs on localhost:4000
